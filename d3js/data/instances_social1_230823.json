Some of them may be tired or having a bad day. Or you might.</p>\n\n<p>You don&#x27;t have to agree with someone to be civil to them. If you can&#x27;t be civil to someone, leave them\n    alone.</p>\n\n<p>If you don&#x27;t wish to interact with someone, or see any of their posts, there are tools at your disposal\n    including mute and block functions.</p>\n\n<p>If someone&#x27;s posts make you angry or upset, take some time to calm down before you reply. You might also try\n    simply excusing yourself from a conversation and ask them to untag you if you no longer wish to discuss a topic.</p>\n\n<div style=\"padding-top:1em;\"></div>\n\n<p>When someone asks you to leave them alone, leave them alone. If you feel like you can&#x27;t control your urge to\n    respond to that person, use the block or mute feature so you won&#x27;t see their posts and be tempted.</p>\n\n<p>Keep in mind that while you cannot control other people&#x27;s behavior, you are still responsible for your own\n    conduct, even if you feel someone was rude to you or someone else.</p>\n\n<p>We will not allow abusive or disruptive conduct by or toward users on social.tchncs.de. This includes continuing to\n    engage in conversation with someone who has specifically requested you leave them alone, inciting other users to\n    engage with that person on your behalf, aggregating and posting another person&#x27;s personal information without\n    their consent, and inciting others to engage with that person on other platforms. Blocking someone and then sitting\n    on the other side of a block and continuing to talk about that person is also a provoking behavior.</p>\n\n<p>Before you post, think about whether this is the kind of thing you would like to see (or would like your mom or kids\n    to see) in the public timeline. There are post visibility settings that give you some control over which timelines\n    your post appears in, and also CW and NSFW buttons to hide specific text and images in your post.

The other endpoint is a human being with an inner life just as complex as your own. Act accordingly.</li>\n<li>Consider the reach of the posts you make. Tag content that you expect others might not want to see.</li>\n<li>Harassment and bullying of any kind are not tolerated here. Do not engage with a user if they do not want you to. Do not ask other users to, either.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2><a id=\"Dont_start_shit_5\"></a>Don’t start shit.</h2>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Do not make posts just to get angry reactions.</li>\n<li>“I was being ironic” is an extremely flimsy excuse for behaving badly.</li>\n<li>Do not drag unrelated people into a discussion.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2><a id=\"Obey_the_law_10\"></a>Obey the law.</h2>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Specifically, German (server location) and Estonian (owner location) law.</li>\n<li>No illegal file sharing, no illegal pornography, no publication of personal protected information, no holocaust denial, you know the drill.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2><a id=\"Spam_is_not_allowed_14\"></a>Spam is not allowed.</h2>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Bots that interact with a user without a users explicit request are not allowed.</li>\n<li>Automated or excessive advertising is not allowed.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2><a id=\"Be_aware_of_the_nature_of_the_network_18\"></a>Be aware of the nature of the network.</h2>\n\n<ul>\n<li>This website is part of a network of similar websites. Other websites may have different rules.</li>\n<li>The local administration has little control over users of other websites. You can, however, block and mute them - same as local users.</li>\n<li>In egregious cases, remote users or entire groups of users may be blocked from interacting with users of this website.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2><a id=\"Fascism_is_incompatible_with_a_free_exchange_of_ideas_23\"></a>Fascism is incompatible with a free exchange of ideas.</h2>\n\n<ul>\n<li>When you endorse racism, exclusion and the structural and physical violence that come with it, you show yourself to not be interested in any sort of dialogue.</li>\n<li>Those who work towards a society based on chauvinism and nationalism rather than peaceful coexistance are not welcome here.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2><a id=\"Admin_decisions_are_final_27\"></a>Admin decisions are final.</h2>\n\n<ul>\n<li>The interpretation of these rules is up to the administration and an admins decision overrides the rules.</li>\n<li>“Technically I did not violate any rule” is an extremely flimsy excuse for behaving badly.</li>\n<li>The rules may be changed or amended when necessary.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2><a id=\"These_goal_of_these_rules_is_to_ensure_a_safe_and_welcoming_environment_32\"></a>These goal of these rules is to ensure a safe and welcoming environment.</h2>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Rule enforcement is guided by this goal.</li>\n<li>Any enforcement action will generally be kept between those involved.</li>\n<li>Try to self-moderate, but do not hesitate to involve an admin when necessary.</li>\n<li>There are presently two people with administrative access to the website, @halcy, @dotUser .</li>\n<li>You can report rule violations via the report function, or via e-mail.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>You can find information about our <a href=\"https://icosahedron.website/terms\">terms of service and privacy policy here.</a></p>\n\n<h2>Instance mascot</h2>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://icosahedron.website/@xumbra/108218550019613303\">instance mascot</a> was drawn by <a href=\"https://www.pixiv.net/member.php?id=5176225\">てむれい</a>.</p>\n\n<h2>German legal notices</h2>\n\n<p>\nAls Betreiber dieser Webseite schließe ich eine Haftung, auch fahrlässige, für von Benutzern erstellte, hochgeladene oder verlinkte Inhalte aus.

This instance is running on a VM on the same server as <a href=\"https://imaginair.es\">imaginair.es</a> and <em>is financed using <a href=https://patreon.com/wxcafe>Patreon</a></em> (with the extra coming from <a href=\"https://social.wxcafe.net/@wxcafe\">@wxcafe</a>).\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThis instance does not run Genuine Mastodon©️ Software™️, and instead uses the <a href=\"https://github.com/glitch-soc/mastodon\">Glitch-soc</a> fork. This allows us to have a lot more features, notably accessiblity tweaks, and work with a more open and helpful development team. As such, I'd like to thank <a href=\"https://social.sitedethib.com/@Claire\">Claire</a> for her efforts with the development of both glitch-soc and mainline mastodon, and her precious help with the various problems I have encountered while managing this instance and <a href=\"https://imaginair.es\">imaginair.es</a>.\n</p>\n\n<h3> More </h3>\n\n<p>\nCoffee Mug art by <a href=\"https://mastodon.art/@ciara\">Ciara</a>\n</p>\n\n<p>\nFeel free to contact me for more informations at the email address in the right sidebar, or directly on Mastodon :)\n</p>\n",
